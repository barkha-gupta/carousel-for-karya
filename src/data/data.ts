    testimony:
      "When technology and innovation unite, it can be the catalyst for the creation of global enterprises capable of generating vast revenues and transforming the way people live... Karya's way of advancing social justice is to bring about a transformation in the lives of the people they work with, enabling them to move from merely surviving to thriving, by giving them a stepping stone to the next economic opportunity. While earning money, Karya's villagers are also building skills since, for many, this is their first encounter with a smartphone, a key tool of today's economy. It's a model that's opening a door to poor communities and letting them step in to participate in the economy in a way that would not otherwise be possible.",

      "Karya is building a revolutionary data cooperative and empowering economically disadvantaged people along the way, giving them a pathway out of poverty. Building world-class AI models require a holistic dataset collection with high-accuracy labels and rich demographic diversity. Karya enabled us to effectively target and scale these efforts by providing the highest quality datasets at our speed of growth for building ASR models in Indian languages and dialects. Highly recommend working with this innovative and collaborative team.",

      "I have been working closely with Karya on several language data projects. Karya is the perfect platform for large data design and collection activities that is essential for creating real-world deployable Artificial Intelligence. However, the real value of Karya lies in its social agenda and the impact the team is able to have on the life of the invisible workers without whom such technologies would remain a dream. Karya team has taken digital work to a non-urban, non-tech savvy population and shown that this can be done in an ethical manner that is a win-win for both customers and the data-providers.",
